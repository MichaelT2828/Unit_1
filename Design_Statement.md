I will design and make a text based game for a client who is the owner of a local game shop. The game will be a dungeon crawler,
and will be constructed using the software Python 3.0. It will take 3 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the following criteria: 
The game must be entirely text based, it must record the time played, and it must record the player name and score.
