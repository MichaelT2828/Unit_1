### 1. What are the steps in the design cycle

Planning, design, developement, evaluation, implementation

### 2. What is the purpose of the success criteria

To provide the client with the basic requirements of the proposed solution, so that there is a record of what is being promised to the client. They will be used as a standard to judge the final solution, and decide whether the solution is successful or not. 

### 3. What do you understand now about computers/computer science that you did not understand?

- There are two types of memory, RAM and cache, one (cache) is faster but less storage the other (RAM) has more but takes longer to access.

- Design, planning and documentation is much more important than I realized, since the developer will be the only one to understand the product if there is inadequate documentation. The code itself is less important, since it would be useless if no one else can understand (fix it if it breaks) it. Good coding practice is also vital, so the structure is easier to understand. 

- Programing is not about memorizing all the syntax of a coding language, it is more about understanding the fundamentals how to use certain functions. Google can be very helpful in finding specific solutions to specific problems, so it is less vital to memorize everything. 

### 4. What do you understand now about yourself that you did not before Unit 1?

I tend to jump into doing what I think is fun, rather then take the necessary steps in the beginning (planning and design) that will help later on. This results in me reversing the order of steps to create organized documentation, so I have to kind of catch up with the planning after I finish most of the code.

### 5. What worked well for you during the development of Unit 1?

I was able to apply the things we learned in class (functions, for while if loops, etc.) to create my game, and I felt I had a good understanding of those functions. 

### 6. What didn't work well during the developement of Unit 1?

I struggled to keep up with the planning phase of the game, and had to end up doing a lot of the planning after I finished the code portion.
