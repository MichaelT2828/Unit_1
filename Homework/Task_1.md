## Question 1: Do you think it is necessary to involve the show owner during the process along the three weeks? Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer:

While I don’t think it is necessary to completely involve the shop owner, I think it is important to update the client along the way,
since a lot of the time the client can be too vague on the requirements of the product. In a situation where the client is only shown the finished product,
there are almost always going to be components that don’t fit the client’s vision, forcing the developer to change large parts of the product,
inevitably leading to an ugly and inefficient cycle. Therefore, I think it is important to be somewhat more open with the client,
allowing for a more flexible model of production. 


## Question 2: Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game?
If so, what would some of the MVP look like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?

To a certain extent, since it is almost always better for the client to somewhat understand where the project is going, in case they have a different vision
for the product. However, since it is a game and not a physical product, there developer should be mostly in charge. For my game in particular, an MVP would
be something like a short runthrough of the tutorial, a single battle sequence, or a level in the game. Given these prototypes, the feedback I would expect would
be the effectiveness of the lore and dialogue in immersing the player, how fun the gameplay is, and/or critique on the difficulty.

## Question 3: Do you see similarities between the Human-Centered Design cycle presented in the video and the Design Cycle we use for developing software? Explain.

The mindset of creating something with the intention to make it as friendly to learn how to use is the same between Human-Centered Design and our software Design Cycle.
The software Design Cycle is catered to the user experience, almost always with the goal of allowing the user to accomplish a task as effectively as possible,
and the same goes for the Human-Centered Design cycle, which is based on accessibility to the product even with minimal knowledge of its functions in the beginning.

## Question 4: What are the simple principles for human-centered design presented in the video? Write a sentence with the definition of each.

Discoverability is the ability for a product to convey its method of use to the user as obviously as possible, and allow the user to discover how to use it without needing external support.

Feedback is the response to the user from the product that it is being used correctly, or used incorrectly. For example, a light switching on from a lever peing pulled is a method of showing the user it was used properly.

## Question 5. Consider your game. Think about ways you can improve the Players’ Experience using Human-centered design. Write below your ideas:

- Add an NPC that follows the player, teaching the player some of the more advanced aspects of the game, and giving advice when the player is stuck.
- Incorporate the setting of the game into lore, not only adding to the immersion of the game, but also giving hints to the player on what kind of game it is.
- Always give a response to the player when they input something, such as a simple 'I did not understand that, please try again' when the program does not recognize an input.
